# Day 11

After a hard day, we get a chill day! I fully expected to have to implement a pathfinding algorithm after seeing what
_looked_ like a maze, and I even had Dijkstra's open on another page... but then quickly realized from the example
that I can just use the Manhattan distance and call it a day.
