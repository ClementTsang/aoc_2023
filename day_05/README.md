# Day 05

I found part two kinda tricky, though I do partially blame the 1am brain lag.

I originally actually solved part two by using a REALLY gross reverse-search - this doesn't even work for the
example (since it doesn't consider cases where the location is smaller than what's defined in the mappings), but it
actually gave me the answer for my input, so... that's also a viable strategy I guess.
